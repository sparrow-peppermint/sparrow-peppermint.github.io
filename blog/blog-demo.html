    <p>Why are there so many songs about rainbows
      And what's on the other side?
      Rainbows are visions, but only illusions,
      And rainbows have nothing to hide.
      So we've been told and some choose to believe it
      I know they're wrong, wait and see.
      Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection,
      The lovers, the dreamers and me.
