        <h4>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.
          Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision,
          the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h4>
        <div class="blog-text">
          <p>In my career I was regularly faced with the dilemma of whether it is possible
            to change a broken system from within.
            There is a deeply embedded culture in the entertainment industry
            that is committed to maintaining the status quo.
            Working within that afforded me a platform to connect meaningfully
            with my community and advocate for positive change outside of the industry,
            but it also meant working with people whose values didn't align
            with my own and standing alongside them felt like I was cosigning their behaviour.
            I asked myself often, was that trade off really worth it?
            Was the good that I was contributing to my community reason enough
            to justify staying in a place where myself and other people from marginalised groups were treated so poorly?</p>
          <p>Eventually I chose to come forward and lay out the reality in a public forum.
            I made this decision with the hope that it would contribute to making our industry safer,
            more inclusive and more accountable.
            Ultimately I'm proud of that decision. </p>
        </div>
          <h4>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
          </h4>
          <div class="blog-text">
            <p>I definitely feel like who you are is significantly influenced by who you spend time with.
              If the people around you are exhibiting destructive behaviour,
              even if you don't agree with it, it becomes normalised. This is how I lived for a long time.
              When you instead surround yourself with people who demonstrate compassion,
              empathy, living authentically and doing what's right  <span class="emphasised">in action</span>
              you become empowered to do it yourself. Knowing your values isn't enough to know who you are.
              Living those values in action is what truly informs your identity.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey. 
          </h4>
          <div class="blog-text">
            <p>I am compassionate and open-minded, I like to understand different peoples points of view
              and approach learning with curiosity. This means I am adaptable to changing my opinions
              and ideas when given new information.
            </p>
            <p>I am careful and considered in my choices, and make sure to clearly understand
              what is needed to complete a task before jumping in.
              This helps with organisation and efficiency, as it means only focusing on relevant
              work and asking clarifying questions if I need help. I can anticipate and prepare
              for problems before they arise.
            </p>
            <p>I appreciate the beauty and absurdities of life. I strive to enjoy the process,
              learn and grow as best I can, and connect and engage with others meaningfully.
              This leads to healthy working relationships, staying level-headed when things go wrong,
              and keeping in touch with the big picture.</p>

            </div>
          <h4>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development.
            How might these affect your learning journey? 
          </h4>
          <div class="blog-text">
            <p>I will sometimes fixate on a problem if I don't understand it thoroughly,
              and find it hard to move on to something else. If a simple question is open-ended,
              I may spend time overthinking what it means.
            </p>
            <p>I struggle with assertiveness and leadership. I'm afraid of being responsible
              for a process or outcome that affects others.
              </p>
            <p>I can be overly cautious and unwilling to take risks.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
            but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time,
            how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
          </h4>
          <div class="blog-text">
            <p>I have spent a lot of time working with people who have different values
              and who had a different vision of what was being created. We would end up debating
              our points of view over and over, until we both end up compromising and the end result
              was something neither of us were really proud of.</p>
            <p>In the future I would check in regularly throughout the project, to make sure
              that we agree on the mission and the desired outcome, and share ideas of
              how we can work collaboratively and utilise everyone's strengths to get there.</p>
            <p>Making time to appreciate and celebrate what each person brings to the table,
              as well as understanding and respecting their limitations is important too.
