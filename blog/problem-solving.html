        <h3>A time I was blocked on a simple problem</h3>
        <div class="blog-text">
          <p>This week we were learning about methods in JavaScript.
            These are functions that are built into the language for convenience
            and efficiency, because of how often they are used by developers.
          </p>
          <p>One method I researched was the .sort() function.</p>
          <p>This function takes a list or "array" of values and sorts them alphabetically.
            For example if we performed the .sort() method on this array:</p>
            <p>[ 'Dr. Teeth' ,  'Zoot' ,  'Animal' ,  'Floyd' ,  'Janice' ] </p>
            <p>It will become</p>
            <p>[ 'Animal', 'Dr. Teeth', 'Floyd', 'Janice', 'Zoot' ]</p>
            <p>I also expected that if passed an array of numbers,
              it would sort them numerically by size, however, when I performed
              the .sort() function on this array:</p>
            <p>[ 150 ,  32 ,  345 ,  1 ,  95 ,  40 ]</p>
            <p>It became</p>
            <p> [1, 150, 32, 345, 40, 95 ]</p>
            <p>So I had to figure out why, and how to alter the method so that it could
              be used to sort the numbers by value.</p>
            <p>After some research I found that the .sort() method sorts elements
              by the Unicode point value of the first character. 1 comes before 3,
              which is why 150 will come before 32.</p>
            <p>I messed around for a while and eventually found a way to tell the method
              to treat each value as an integer instead of a Unicode character.
              By adding a function which compared each number by size, I was able to use
              the .sort() method to sort numbers by value.</p>
            <p>Here is the original method, and my modified version for sorting numbers</p>
            <p>array . sort ()<br>array . sort (( a , b ) => a - b )</p>
            <p>This problem solving experience was a combination of trial and error,
              console logging, googling, and learning through reflection.</p>
