        <h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h4>
        <div class="blog-text">
          <p>
            I think in the past I have treated knowing myself and understanding how
            I am as an intellectual exercise, rather than a tool for learning and growing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although I consider myself to be pretty self-aware, I can be quite resistant
            to trying new things and adapting my behaviour.
          </p>            
          <p>
            In order for me to continue practicing compassion and open-mindedness
            towards others, I need to learn to become less self-critical and afford myself
            more grace and patience in my learning.
          </p>

        </div>
          <h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
          <div class="blog-text">
            <p>
              If you consciously take time to understand the perspectives and experiences
              of others, you will have more success in collaborating with and learning from them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Knowing who you are and what is important to you informs how you interact
              with everything. You can become more able to communicate your ideas,
              as well as stay motivated, if you genuinely care about the goal you are working towards.
            </p>

          <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
          </h4>
          <div class="blog-text">
            <p>
              I was surprised by how much time we ended up spending on it.
              I think I also expected the core learning to be more generalised and less personal. 
             </p>
            </div>
          <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning? </h4>
          <div class="blog-text">
            <p>
              Writing the blogs for sure. Trying out the experimental exercises and even
              asking myself these reflective questions was already out of my comfort zone.
              Then the act of trying to summarise and share these reflections with strangers
              made me very uncomfortable at first.
            </p>

          </div>
          <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h4>
          <div class="blog-text">
            <p>
              It makes sense that companies want to hire people who have strong communication
              and interpersonal skills, who are self-aware, open-minded and ready to learn.
              But I also think these skills are beneficial even when we are working alone. Being
              less self-critical and fixed in our idea of ourselves makes us more likely to push outside
              our comfort zone, learn new things, and be less afraid to try or to fail.
            </p>

          </div>
          <h4> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
          <div class="blog-text">
            <p>
              This is a little hard for me to answer. I think I have spent at least half of my
              working hours in foundations doing Core Learning. And for me this is the
              part of foundations I found largely more challenging and less enjoyable.
              I would have been excited to spend more time programming. 
            </p>
            <p>
              But I can see why this journey into self-awareness and EQ learning is valuable in
              getting us prepared to work in a collaborative environment which will include
              long hours and stressful situations. Having compassion, resilience, and good
              communication will make a big difference.
