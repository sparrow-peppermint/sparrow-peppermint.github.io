        <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
        <div class="blog-text">
          <p>When I first started programming I was filled with such joy and curiosity.
            The types of strategic thinking and problem solving that went into it felt like playing a game,
            and I gradually started to realise how dissatisfied I was in my current career.
            When I found out more about the tech industry, the culture and the career opportunities,
            I started to see a real future for me, doing work that I enjoy that offers financial stability.
          </p>
          <p>My long term goal is working towards a career pathway where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I am part of a team where our values align clearly
              and we are able to contribute meaningfully to the community with our work.</li>
            <li>The work is challenging, enjoyable and complements my skills and passions</li>
            <li>I am able to work remotely</li>
            <li>I am able to provide financial stability for my family</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
          <h4>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </h4>
          <div class="blog-text">
            <p>I want to become more comfortable with getting things wrong
              and approaching mistakes as opportunities for growth.
              I want to find peace in being myself and doing my best,
              and spend less energy trying to control how I am perceived.
            </p>
            <p>I think that this will also help me to make bolder choices
              and take more chances where I would have otherwise stayed in my comfort zone.
            </p> 
          </div>
          <h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme 
          </h4>
          <div class="blog-text">
            <p>I am committed to planning and scheduling my time effectively,
              and staying on top of my workload to avoid getting overwhelmed by deadlines.
              I will have patience and grace for myself and other students
              as we take on this challenge together, and remember the big picture.
              We are all coming into this with our own unique strengths and limitations,
              and learning about ourselves and developing skills along the way.
              I will be considerate of the time and effort of others,
              offering only encouraging and constructive feedback. </p>
            </div>
          <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way 
          </h4>
          <div class="blog-text">
            <p>I will be realistic and honest about where I'm at in my learning.
              When I come across obstacles I will communicate this to facilitators
              and other students where appropriate. I acknowledge that when working in a team,
              being present and honest about where I'm at is important for myself and other students. </p>

          </div>
          <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team 
          </h4>
          <div class="blog-text">
            <p>A supportive and non-judgemental environment where seeking help
              is met with encouragement as well as practical advice.
              As someone who has been historically reluctant to reach out for support,
              the experience of interacting with facilitators here so far has made me so much more comfortable
              and excited about doing this course!
              One of my biggest challenges coming into this was learning how to ask for help
              and engage with others, and I already feel that I am building confidence in this area.</p>

          <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things 
          </h4>
          <div class="blog-text">
            <p>I am coming into this with the privilege of being able to commit myself to the program fully over this time.</p>
