          <li>Awareness and understanding of your own emotions, as well as those of others.</li>
          <li>The ability to regulate your reactions to your emotions, and consider how your actions affect others.</li>
          <li>Taking in the whole picture, being mindful of context, and adapting behaviour as appropriate.</li>
          <li>Demonstrating empathy for others, considering their point of view and seeking genuine understanding
            of their emotions and experiences before acting.</li>
          <li>Noticing when you are experiencing a strong feeling and taking time to name and understand it
            rather than engage with it right away.</li>

          <h3><span>How is EQ different to IQ?</span></h3>
          <p class="blog-text">Intelligence Quotient or IQ is measured using standardised tests
            which have been developed by researchers since the late 1800's.
            These tests are designed to measure one's ability to learn and
            understand information quickly, use logical reasoning, identify
            relevant information when problem solving, and apply and understand mathematics concepts.
          </p> 
          <p class="blog-text">
            While there has been research into the importance of “social intelligence”
            since the 1940's, our current understanding of Emotional Quotient
            was first introduced 1985, and has developed significantly in the
            last 20 years. Emotional Quotient describes ones ability to perceive
            and understand emotions, empathise with others, and regulate their emotions and reactions.
            
          </p>
          <p class="blog-text">IQ and EQ measure a completely different set of skills.
            There is no consensus on if one's IQ affects one's EQ or visa versa.
     
          <p class="blog-text emphasised">
            It is important to note:<br>
            While IQ tests were originally intended to help identify and support
            the needs of students, they have been used throughout history as
            a tool for discrimination, racism and eugenics. It is important to
            acknowledge the significant harm that IQ testing has caused.

          <h3><span>What is a Class?</span></h3>
          <p class="blog-text">If you want a set of styling rules that will be used on multiple elements in your code, it's time to make a class.
            Unlike an ID, Classes can be used on multiple elements throughout your code. And just as a class can be assigned to multiple elements,
            an element can have multiple classes. Classes are denoted by a . symbol.
          <h3><span>How do you create and use a Class?</span></h3>
          <p class="blog-text">Add a new class to your stylesheet using the . Symbol followed by the class name.
            Here is an example of a class that makes the font-size 20px and the colour red:</p>
