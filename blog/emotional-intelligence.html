        <h3><span>What is emotional Intelligence</span></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Awareness and understanding of your own emotions, as well as those of others.</li>
          <li>The ability to regulate your reactions to your emotions, and consider how your actions affect others.</li>
          <li>Taking in the whole picture, being mindful of context, and adapting behaviour as appropriate.</li>
          <li>Demonstrating empathy for others, considering their point of view and seeking genuine understanding
            of their emotions and experiences before acting.</li>
          <li>Noticing when you are experiencing a strong feeling and taking time to name and understand it
            rather than engage with it right away.</li>

          <h3><span>What is a ID?</span></h3>
          <p class="blog-text">If you want to apply a unique set of styling rules to one element in your code, IDs are the way to do this.
            Each ID connects only to one element, and each element can have only one ID assigned to it.
          <h3><span>How do you create and use an ID?</span></h3>
          <p class="blog-text">IDs, like other styling rules, must be declared in your stylesheet.
            They are denoted by the # symbol. Here is an example of an ID that makes an element's background-colour green and width 800px:</p>

          <h3><span>What is a Class?</span></h3>
          <p class="blog-text">If you want a set of styling rules that will be used on multiple elements in your code, it's time to make a class.
            Unlike an ID, Classes can be used on multiple elements throughout your code. And just as a class can be assigned to multiple elements,
            an element can have multiple classes. Classes are denoted by a . symbol.
          <h3><span>How do you create and use a Class?</span></h3>
          <p class="blog-text">Add a new class to your stylesheet using the . Symbol followed by the class name.
            Here is an example of a class that makes the font-size 20px and the colour red:</p>
