          <li>Awareness and understanding of your own emotions, as well as those of others.</li>
          <li>The ability to regulate your reactions to your emotions, and consider how your actions affect others.</li>
          <li>Taking in the whole picture, being mindful of context, and adapting behaviour as appropriate.</li>
          <li>Demonstrating empathy for others, considering their point of view and seeking genuine understanding
            of their emotions and experiences before acting.</li>
          <li>Noticing when you are experiencing a strong feeling and taking time to name and understand it
            rather than engage with it right away.</li>

          <h3><span>How is EQ different to IQ?</span></h3>
          <p class="blog-text">Intelligence Quotient or IQ is measured using standardised tests
            which have been developed by researchers since the late 1800's.
            These tests are designed to measure one's ability to learn and
            understand information quickly, use logical reasoning, identify
            relevant information when problem solving, and apply and understand mathematics concepts.
          </p> 
          <p class="blog-text">
            While there has been research into the importance of “social intelligence”
            since the 1940's, our current understanding of Emotional Quotient
            was first introduced 1985, and has developed significantly in the
            last 20 years. Emotional Quotient describes ones ability to perceive
            and understand emotions, empathise with others, and regulate their emotions and reactions.
            
          </p>
          <p class="blog-text">IQ and EQ measure a completely different set of skills.
            There is no consensus on if one's IQ affects one's EQ or visa versa.
     
          <p class="blog-text emphasised">
            It is important to note:<br>
            While IQ tests were originally intended to help identify and support
            the needs of students, they have been used throughout history as
            a tool for discrimination, racism and eugenics. It is important to
            acknowledge the significant harm that IQ testing has caused.

          <h3><span>Why is EQ important?</span></h3>
          <p>Developing our EQ enables us to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Think more objectively and understand how our limitations, world-view and life experience influence our reactions and feelings.
            <li>Connect with and understand others in a meaningful way, strengthening our sense of community and making collaborating more effective and more enjoyable.
            </li>
            <li>Have agency and control over how we act and who we chose to be.</li>
          </ul>
