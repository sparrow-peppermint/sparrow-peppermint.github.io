          I had previously described HTML and CSS as a symbiotic couple who appreciate each others' skills and use their 
          different passions and abilities to work together. So, how does JavaScript fit into the picture?
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Let's imagine HTML and CSS are this couple.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          'HTML' is the practical, organised one who likes to collect facts and make informed decisions.<br>
          'CSS' is the dreamy, creative one, who brings warmth, colour, and magic wherever they go.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          'JavaScript' is like the master document of all the things they
          have learned about each other over the years, which informs
          how they interact. 'HTML' and 'CSS' operate
          differently, and over the course of their relationship they have
          learned patterns and actions that help them to understand and support each other.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          If 'CSS' runs out of oat milk, 'JavaScript' tells 'HTML' they should get some on their way home.
          If 'HTML' is anxious, 'JavaScript' tells 'CSS' to put on their favourite show to comfort them.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          JavaScript contains the <a class="emphasised">actions</a> they take to make their relationship work so well.
        </p>

          <h3><span>What is a ID?</span></h3>
          <p class="blog-text">If you want to apply a unique set of styling rules to one element in your code, IDs are the way to do this.
            Each ID connects only to one element, and each element can have only one ID assigned to it.
          <h3><span>How do you create and use an ID?</span></h3>
          <p class="blog-text">IDs, like other styling rules, must be declared in your stylesheet.
            They are denoted by the # symbol. Here is an example of an ID that makes an element's background-colour green and width 800px:</p>

          <h3><span>What is a Class?</span></h3>
          <p class="blog-text">If you want a set of styling rules that will be used on multiple elements in your code, it's time to make a class.
            Unlike an ID, Classes can be used on multiple elements throughout your code. And just as a class can be assigned to multiple elements,
            an element can have multiple classes. Classes are denoted by a . symbol.
          <h3><span>How do you create and use a Class?</span></h3>
          <p class="blog-text">Add a new class to your stylesheet using the . Symbol followed by the class name.
            Here is an example of a class that makes the font-size 20px and the colour red:</p>
